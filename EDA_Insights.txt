CO2 Emissions Divergence: Developing countries show a clear upward trend in per capita CO2 emissions, especially post-2020, reflecting rapid industrialization, while developed countries maintain more stable, moderate emissions with smaller fluctuations.

Population Volatility: Developed countries experience steadier population growth with fewer dramatic changes, whereas developing countries show higher volatility in population averages, influenced by socioeconomic factors like birth rates and migration.

Renewable Energy Adoption: Developed countries demonstrate more consistent growth in renewable energy share (mostly 25%-34%), while developing countries exhibit more fluctuating and inconsistent renewable adoption patterns.

Forest Area Trends: Developed countriesâ€™ forest areas fluctuate between 35%-50% with periods of preservation and deforestation; developing countries show similar volatility but with more pronounced deforestation and less sustained recovery.

Temperature and Weather Extremes: Both country groups face similar temperature ranges and volatile extreme weather event frequencies; no clear evidence that forest area or renewable share alone reduces temperature spikes or event frequency nationally.

Population and Environmental Impact: High population countries contribute more to total emissions making scale a bigger issue than per capita rates, while renewable energy shares tend to be higher but more volatile in populous countries, which also face greater deforestation pressures.

Renewables Mitigate Emissions Growth but Not Resilience: Countries with high renewable energy share tend to show slower and more stable CO2 emission growth; however, this does not clearly translate into fewer extreme weather events or measurable temperature benefits at a national level.
